# Context Menu

An implementation of a generic context menu in TypeScript. This was originally
based on MathJax's context menu from v2.7 and has been further developed to be
compatible and part of subsequent MathJax releases, starting with v3.

**Note that as of release v1.0, this repository is now archived. No further
standalone releases of `mj-context-menu` will be published, except possibly for
minor patch releases. Ongoing development has moved to the main MathJax source
repository, and future releases will be published under the `@mathjax` scope.**
